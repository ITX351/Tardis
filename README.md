This project is developed for a software engineering class in HIT, 13CS. It uses Ruby on Rails platform. Three iterations has passed. 
This is a website for campus navigation to include all the position information of HIT in our map, such as building, supermarket, print shop, canteens, expresses and so on. 
We will try to add all the position users want to go to in our map after the administrators examined. 
When user searches for what he want to do or where he want to go, we will give several destinations fitting either name or classify, and compare the difference between them and show the information to users. Once user determined his destination, we will show a path in map and tell him how to get to the destination.
Users could also submit some information or suggestions to tell us the wrong information in our website (such as some position information are obsolete), then we will confirm the submit information and update our website. Users can also do comment on these information. 

Special thank to our teacher, and classmates, who supported help for us.
